- **[blank-bot](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/blank-bot)** - starter bot for StarCraft II with integrated cpp-sc2;
- **[commandcenter](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/commandcenter)** - original version of CommandCenter bot with integrated cpp-sc2;
- **[docker-sc2](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/docker-sc2)** - dockerized StarCraft II Linux client.

There are many more [useful resources](https://github.com/aiarena/awesome-sc2-ai) related to the game and frameworks.

### What should I know before the start?

**Code guidelines**
We do our best to conform to [the Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with the exception that we use four space tabs instead of two space tabs.

**Commit guidelines**
We follow the semantic versioning approach, this is important so your PR will appear on the Changelog ðŸŽ‰ ! I guess you expect recognition and we will give it to you.
See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#commit-message-convention-at-a-glance) for commit guidelines.

The list of supported commit message prefixes:

- `feat` - a new feature or API improvements;
- `fix` - a bugfix;
- `perf` - performance improvements;
- `refactor` - code refactoring;
- `test` - functional or unit tests;
- `build` - build system improvements,  also includes CI improvements;
- `docs` - documentation improvements;
- `chore` - routine task, e.g. create new release (doesn't appear in the changelog);
- `style` - fix code style, no functional changes (doesn't appear in the changelog.

### Before PR

* Keep the PR small as possible and one single topic for each.
* Write good commit message: describe what was the problem and why the changes required.
* Consider implementing a test.
